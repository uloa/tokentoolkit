# tokentoolkit
A toolkit used in social engineering which will send tokens to a webhook when a victim runs the scripts. When compiled to an .exe, then it will install python if necessary.

You may need to install pyinstaller module for the compiler to work. When you want to create an exe, just runthje compiler batchfile and then it will generate a dist folder with the exe in it. To change the icon, you may need to use resource tuner or resource hacker if you wish.

-DISCLAIMER-
The script that steals the tokens is not made by me. I have created everything else in this repo
